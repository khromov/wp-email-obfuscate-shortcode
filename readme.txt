Obfuscate your email address or other sensitive information with a shortcode to prevent spam and automated harvesting of data.

== Description ==
Obfuscate your email address or other sensitive information with a shortcode to prevent harvesting of your data.

Version 2.0 includes an improved way of displaying the email without relying on JavaScript document.write();

**Usage**

*Basic usage*

[email-obfuscate email="bob@example.com"]

*Setting custom link text*

[email-obfuscate email="bob@example.com" link_title="Email Bob!"]

*Setting custom link title attribute"

[email-obfuscate email="bob@example.com" tag_title="Email Bob!"]

*Using every available setting (this example shows their default values)*

[email-obfuscate email="bob@example.com" linkable="1" link_title="" use_htmlentities="1" use_noscript_fallback="1" noscript_message="Please enable JavaScript to see this field."]

**Usage from a template or plugin**

Below is a snippet that you can use in any template or plugin to apply the same obfuscation to an email as using the shortcode:

if(function_exists('eos_obfuscate'))
{
  echo eos_obfuscate(array('email' => $email, 'link_title' => 'Email Bob!'));
}
else 
{
  echo $email;
}
    
If the plugin is not enabled, the email address will just pass through and output in cleartext.

== Requirements ==
* PHP 5.3 or higher
* mbstring extension

== Translations ==
* Swedish

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `email-obfuscate-shortcode` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin (Email Obfuscate Shortcode) through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use the shortcode in any post, page or custom post type.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin prevent my email address or other personal information from being harvested? =

Email Obfuscate Shortcode converts your email address into JavaScript-based snippet. This makes the address unreadable to the vast majority
of email harvesting techniques.

= What browsers is this plugin compatible with? =
Internet Explorer 6 and up, any Firefox, Chrome, Safari or Opera version.

= How do you obfuscate information other than email addresses? =

To obfuscate phone numbers, names and other sensitive information, pass the parameter linkable="0". This will print anything you
put in the "email" field as text onto your page, fully protected.

= Will people without JavaScript see my email address? =

People without JavaScript will see a placeholder message urging them to enable JavaScript. The current placeholder message reads:
"Please enable JavaScript to see this field."

You can customize this message by passing the noscript_message="" parameter to the shortcode.

= Is the solution bulletproof? =

This protection has been proven very effective. However it is theoretically possible to harvest the email address if you run a real browser that resolves javascript (Selenium, Mechanical Turk workers etc.)
